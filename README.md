# The Electric Meatball - Node Version

The intent of this project is purely an exercise in making a website in the most obnoxious way
possible--purely through Vanilla Javascript. The main HTML file only has 4 divs: a parent container
and 3 children within it. These children are the primary targets being appended to in order to
display the website's content.

Why? Just to see if I can. I wanted to challenge myself. Rather than making a todo list or some
other arbitrary project I decided to make a useful tool for myself. I decided to remake my original
Electric Meatball console application, that was made with Python, in Vanilla JS served from a Node
backend statically. This way I could more easily visualize my chats as well as interface with the
application more easily. Plus this project has the added bonus of challenging and sharpening my
existing web development skills--who couldn't use more of that?

The main driver behind the frontend portion of this project is the `RadLib` which is library I am
making to render and manipulate the DOM objects at a lower level. It handles all the ugly code.

# This is still a work in progress.
